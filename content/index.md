## A Database for Brick

HodDB is a specialized RDF/SPARQLl triplestore database for [Brick](http://brickschema.org/). 
It stores models of buildings and serves queries on those models.

HodDB has the following goals:

* sub-100ms SPARQL queries on Brick graphs 
* facilitate integration with external services:
    * use Literals to store timeseries UUIDs or application URIs
* [BOSSWAVE](https://github.com/immesys/bw2) integration
* store the history of changes to the Brick model of the building
    * (currently under development)

### Quickstart

```bash
$ sudo apt install libraptor2-dev graphviz
$ go get github.com/gtfierro/hod
$ go install github.com/gtfierro/hod
$ hod load path/to/building.ttl
$ hod server

```

From Docker:

```bash
$ sudo apt install docker.io # if necessary
$ docker pull gtfierro/hoddb
